## Instructions:

The Venture is a hybrid Bluetooth and wired mechanical keyboard that can be used in a variety of ways.

To turn on your keyboard in Bluetooth mode, press and hold the power button for 5 seconds on the top multi-function row.

### Bluetooth Connection
The Venture can connect and pair to up to four (4) separate devices easily.
Press and hold — Fn + (1, 2, 3, or 4) to designate which bluetooth slot to pair to.

The device will then become discoverable to all nearby devices. Connect to your device using the appropriate Bluetooth settings.

Your device will be found under the name Hexgears BK-1. Subsequent slots are labeled: BK-2, BK-3, and BK-4 respectively.

> **Example:** Press and hold Fn + 1 to designate the Venture as Hexgears BK-1 and pair with your computer. Then, press and hold Fn + 2 to designate the Venture as Hexgears BK-2 and pair with your phone. 

After pairing is completed, simply press another paired slot to connect to the previously assigned device seamlessly.

#### Bluetooth Notes:

If the keyboard cannot be connected to a Bluetooth device within 3 minutes, it will enter sleep mode to conserve battery life. When connected to your Bluetooth device, the Venture will enter light power saving mode and turn off LEDs if not used within 90 seconds. If the device is not used in 15 minutes, the keyboard will enter deep sleep mode, you can press any key to wake the Venture from this state. 

Turn off the keyboard fully at any time by holding the Power button for 5 seconds, found on the top multi-function row.


### Wired Mode
To use your keyboard in wired mode, simply plug it in using the included USB Type-C Cable. No drivers are required to use the Hexgears Venture - it should function without software or additional drivers required.

You can switch between Bluetooth and wired modes by pressing the Bluetooth button on the multi-function row. The indicator will change colors to indicate the mode.

### Bluetooth Color Indicators:

Bluetooth and Wireless Mode ON - Blue
Bluetooth and Wired Mode ON - Purple
Wired Mode only ON - Green
Charging - Orange
Fully Charged - Green

### Lighting Options
Three dedicated lighting keys sit in the top multi-function row.
K Symbol — Cycle Backlighting styles
S Symbol — Cycle Side Ring-lighting styles
Lightbulb Symbol — Cycle backlighting and ring-lighting on/off (Both on, only ring-lighting, only backlighting, neither on.)

Pressing Fn + K Symbol or S Symbol will cycle through color options, for backlighting or ring-lighting respectively.

### Factory Reset
To reset your keyboard to default settings and clear memory, press and hold Fn + Esc for 5 seconds. The lighting will briefly disable and re-enable in the default rainbow lighting animation if done successfully.

### Macro Recording
The Venture supports Macro recording on the Y, U, I, O, and P keys. To enter macro recording mode press Fn + F11 and watch the Y, U, I, O, and P keys light up. Press one of these 5 (Y, U, I, O, or P) keys to designate it as the macro key. Then press the key or string of keys you want to be the macro and finish by pressing Fn + F11 to save. 

To enter Macro Mode and use your macros during gaming, simply press Fn+ Y and the Y, U, I, O, and P keys will light up white. The normal function of these keys will be replaced with your macro you defined. To exit Macro mode and return to normal keyboard use - simply press Fn + Y again. 

### Light Macro Recording / Per Key Lighting
Press and Hold Fn + F9 for 3 seconds to enter Light Macro/Per Key Recording Mode. To cycle through the available colors, press each key until it is the appropriate color. To save your lighting setup, quickly press Fn + F9 to exit Light Macro Recording Mode. If you go into a different light mode and want to return to your custom light macro, simply press Fn + F9 to return to your defined setup.
